It includes a client ssh and server sshd, file transfer utilities scp and sftp as well as tools for key generation (ssh-keygen), run-time key storage (ssh-agent) and a number of supporting programs.\nI'll be using OpenSSH to remotely manage and transfer files to my media server.\nFirst, ensure your system is up to date. 1sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade Next, install OpenSSH Server. 1sudo apt-get install openssh-server Check the status of the SSH service. After installing, the SSH service should start automatically but you can verify this by running:\n1sudo systemctl status ssh If the service is not running, you can start it by running:\n1sudo systemctl start ssh Configuring SSH and ufw Firewall. Now that SSH is installed and the service is running, let's go over some config changes.\nDisable root login through SSH. Change default SSH port. Allowing that port through the firewall. Using SSH keys for authentication. Disabling root login. Open the sshd_config file with your text editor of choice. Nano or gedit should be default installed options, though vim is preferred.\n1sudo vim etc/ssh/sshd_config Locate the \u0026quot;PermitRootLogin\u0026quot; line and set it to \u0026quot;no\u0026quot;\n1PermitRootLogin no Also set ChallengeResponseAuthentication and UsePAM to no\n1ChallengeResponseAuthentication no 2UsePAM no Now, let's change the default port for SSH to run on. Note that security through obscurity is not a valid form of security, but this will reduce the amount of spam in log files from automated attempts.\n1sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config Locate the line containing \u0026quot;#Port 22\u0026quot;, and change this to a port of your choosing, ideally between 1024-65535. Make sure to choose a port that isn't already in use by another service on your machine.\n1#Port 22 Becomes\n1Port 1337 Replace 1337 with your actual port number.\nNow let's allow this port through the firewall. First, if you haven't installed Uncomplicated Firewall, do so.\n1sudo apt install ufw Enable it with:\n1sudo ufw enable Next, allow SSH on the new port.\n1sudo ufw allow 1337/tcp Again, remember to substitute your actual port number here.\nSSH remote login. Verify that you can SSH in to your server from your client PC.\n1ssh -p 1337 username@your_server_ip Replace the port, username, and IP address with your actual infomation.\nYou can obtain your server's local network IP address with the following command:\n1ip addr show You may also need to restart the SSH service to apply the new config.\n1sudo systemctl restart ssh After entering the password for the user account, you should now be able to remotely access the server through SSH.\nUsing SSH keys for Authentication Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine with\n1ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 Copy the public key from your local machine to the server (the default location for the key should be ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub).\n1ssh-copy-id username@your_server_ip Verify that your key is working by logging in remotely again.\n1ssh -p 1337 username@your_server_ip If you set a password for you key on creation, you will be prompted to enter it now.\nOnce you are able to authenticate via SSH key, you may disable password authentication in the config file for additional security.\n1sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config And set the PasswordAuthentication line to no.\n1PasswordAuthentication no Optionally, we can set up fail2ban for SSH. 1sudo apt-get install fail2ban First, copy the default fail2ban config file to a new file that we can modify.\n1sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local Open the jail.local file and add the following configurations under the [sshd] section.\n1sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local 1[sshd] 2enabled = true 3port = 4096 4filter = sshd 5maxretry = 3 6bantime = 86400 Lastly, restart SSH and fail2ban to apply the latest config changes.\n1sudo systemctl restart ssh \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo systemctl restart fail2ban ","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/howto_ssh/","section":"post","tags":["misc","ssh"],"title":"Configuring OpenSSH"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/misc/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"misc"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/ssh/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ssh"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"Ventoy is a program that allows a USB drive to function as an installer/live instance of multiple operating systems at once. Once set up, the USB is still able to store files like usual, but if selected as a boot drive, it will display a menu with all of the .iso files on the drive to choose from.\nWhat you'll need. USB drive (anything larger than 1 GB should work). Computer running Linux or Windows. .iso or other supported file type. These can be found on Ventoy's main page. First, download and extract Ventoy. Once extracted, run ventoy2disk.exe Select your USB drive from the drop down list and install Ventoy. Next, place your .iso file on the drive. For convenience, you can create a designated folder to store your .iso files, though this is not necessary.\nNavigate to your BIOS and set the Ventoy USB as the boot device. BIOS interfaces vary by manufacturer, but can typically be accessed by pressing the 'DEL' or 'F2' key while your PC is booting. Verify this for your machine.\nOnce in the BIOS, you will be able to edit the boot order to allow booting from the newly minted Ventoy live USB.\nFinally, select your desired operating system from the Ventoy menu. From here you will be able to install the OS if desired, or simply utilize it as a normal live USB.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/howto_ventoy/","section":"post","tags":["misc","ventoy"],"title":"How to Install and use Ventoy"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/ventoy/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ventoy"},{"body":"Downloads File name SHA-256 Platform Release Date Size DbBuddy_v0.1.1_windows.exe edb540377eb1d18c\n9ef77b6e0814a2a6\ne6910cc88cef6824\nc2d2ed5cf59ce661 Windows 2023-12-30 1.84 MB InterSniffer_v1.0.1_installer_x64.msix d55c068d7f9449b8\nc1517e03da84b080\n1d7e79be23a0c217\n663fda32103ba8ff Windows 2023-08-17 43.8 MB ","link":"http://localhost:1313/downloads/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
