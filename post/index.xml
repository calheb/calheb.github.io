This is a simple tutorial to set up SSH on a Debian server.
OpenSSH is a complete implementation of the SSH protocol (version 2) for secure remote login, command execution and file transfer. It includes a client ssh and server sshd, file transfer utilities scp and sftp as well as tools for key generation (ssh-keygen), run-time key storage (ssh-agent) and a number of supporting programs.
I'll be using OpenSSH to remotely manage and transfer files to my media server.</description></item><item><title>How to Install and use Ventoy</title><link>https://caleb.foo/post/howto_ventoy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caleb.foo/post/howto_ventoy/</guid><description>
Ventoy is a program that allows a USB drive to function as an installer/live instance of multiple operating systems at once. Once set up, the USB is still able to store files like usual, but if selected as a boot drive, it will display a menu with all of the .iso files on the drive to choose from.
What you'll need. USB drive (anything larger than 1 GB should work). Computer running Linux or Windows.</description></item></channel></rss>
